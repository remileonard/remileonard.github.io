When I wanted to integrate *Strike Commander* maps into my port of *Flight* (SGI Dogfight), I initially managed to load the map background but without the objects. Upon examining the code, I noticed that the objects were identified but not loaded. So, I modified the code to handle object loading and display. It was during this first execution that I noticed something strange: the objects were indeed present, but they appeared to be in the wrong positions.

Here's how I solved this problem.

## The Coordinate System

As is often the case, when encountering a bug, the root cause is likely to be found... between the chair and the keyboard. To ensure that I hadn‚Äôt made any mistakes, I needed to better understand the inner workings of the system to verify that the data matched what I was using for display.

### First Clues:

In the December 1994 issue of [GDM](/assets/docs/GDM_December_1994.pdf), Wayne Sike analyzes the coordinate system used in *Pacific Strike* and provides initial documentation of the various *chunks* encountered in the game's IFF files.

Using the article's information, I implemented a first version. In doing so, I discovered a key difference from the original code: coordinates were not stored as 16-bit integers but as 24-bit integers for two axes (X, Y), while the Z-axis was 16-bit. The article also mentioned that coordinates are relative to the game zones where objects should be positioned. I implemented the data structures to store these zone coordinates accordingly.

Once everything was recompiled, a problem arose: some objects referenced a zone with an ID of 255. Since this zone didn‚Äôt exist, the program crashed spectacularly. The issue was that not all objects used relative coordinates. Some had fixed coordinates, which was signaled by a zone ID of 255.

After fixing this bug, everything seemed good to go‚Äîthough the article might suggest otherwise! üòâ


### Endianness

*Strike Commander* is a PC game designed for [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) processors, which use little-endian representation for internal data. However, in the game's IFF files, chunk sizes are stored in big-endian format.

Did I mention the problem between the chair and the keyboard?

Since some data was already loaded in big-endian format, I implemented data loading in big-endian. Big mistake! When I checked the coordinate values, everything was completely nonsensical. I turned to my trusty hex editor, [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/), and took a closer look. One of the editor's features allowed me to convert data from big to little-endian. Once I did that, everything started making sense. I updated my code to handle endianness correctly.


### Y or Z?

The objects were now visible on the map, but they were still misplaced. The issue stemmed from the representation of the X, Y, and Z axes. *RealSpace* uses the Z-axis for height, while OpenGL uses the Y-axis for the same purpose. After swapping the axes, I finally had objects on the ground instead of floating.

Still, something wasn‚Äôt right. Some objects appeared to be correctly placed‚Äîespecially those near the center of the map‚Äîbut as I moved further away, they seemed to be on the opposite side of their intended locations.


### Drawing the Map

To resolve this final issue, I decided to use the game itself for reference. The game holds ‚Äúthe truth,‚Äù and by correlating in-game data with map positions, I could determine the correct placement for objects.

My first step was to get the map. Easy enough‚ÄîI launched the game and took a screenshot.

Next, I delved into the coordinate system. Returning to Wayne Sike‚Äôs article, I noted that the center of the map corresponds to (0,0) and that each block represents a 20,000-unit square.

With the map in hand, I compared my coordinate system with the game‚Äôs. This allowed me to confirm that the values were being loaded correctly and to pinpoint the source of the positioning issue: the Z-axis. 

In my coordinate system, which uses a right-handed frame of reference, negative Z-values indicate forward movement. Once I inverted the Z-values, everything fell into place‚Äîthe objects were finally in their correct locations.

Well... almost. But that's a story for another time, when we tackle the mission script system!


## To conclude, a small diagram

Here is a snippet of the class diagram for the implementation of the mission system in *Strike Commander*.
